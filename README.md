# Chess Mixer

## Python Environment Setup
Set up python environment in Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source ./.venv/bin/activate
```
Set up python environment for Windos:
```cmd
python.exe -m venv .venv
```

If any of this methods fails, a quick Google search would suffice
